# Requirements: File Operations

## Feature Overview
Implement safe file system operations that prevent data loss and provide clear feedback to users during memory bank file generation and management.

## User Stories

### US-001: Safe File Creation
**As a** user  
**I want** files to be created safely without overwriting existing content  
**So that** I don't lose important project files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I run memory-banks init THEN existing files are not overwritten without permission
- WHEN a file already exists THEN I am prompted to confirm overwrite
- WHEN I choose to overwrite THEN the original file is backed up first
- WHEN I choose not to overwrite THEN the file is skipped with a clear message

### US-002: Automatic Backup Creation
**As a** user  
**I want** automatic backups of existing files before modification  
**So that** I can recover if something goes wrong

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I overwrite an existing file THEN a backup is created with timestamp
- WHEN I overwrite multiple files THEN each file gets its own backup
- WHEN I view the backup THEN I can see the original content
- WHEN I need to restore THEN I can easily identify and restore from backup

### US-003: Directory Structure Creation
**As a** user  
**I want** directories to be created automatically as needed  
**So that** I don't need to manually create folder structures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I specify a nested file path THEN parent directories are created automatically
- WHEN I create the .memory-bank directory THEN it has appropriate permissions
- WHEN I create nested directories THEN all parent directories are created
- WHEN directory creation fails THEN I get a clear error message

### US-004: File Permission Management
**As a** user  
**I want** files to be created with appropriate permissions  
**So that** they work correctly in my development environment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I create memory bank files THEN they have readable permissions
- WHEN I create executable files THEN they have executable permissions
- WHEN I create configuration files THEN they have appropriate ownership
- WHEN permission setting fails THEN I get a clear error message

### US-005: Dry Run Mode
**As a** user  
**I want** to preview file operations before executing them  
**So that** I can understand what will be created or modified

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I run with --dry-run THEN no files are actually created
- WHEN I run with --dry-run THEN I see a list of files that would be created
- WHEN I run with --dry-run THEN I see which existing files would be backed up
- WHEN I run with --dry-run THEN I see the content that would be written

### US-006: File Validation
**As a** user  
**I want** generated files to be validated after creation  
**So that** I know the setup completed successfully

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN files are created THEN their content is validated
- WHEN file creation fails THEN I get specific error information
- WHEN validation fails THEN I get guidance on how to fix issues
- WHEN all files are valid THEN I get a success confirmation

## Technical Requirements

### TR-001: File System Operations
```typescript
interface FileOperations {
  createFile(path: string, content: string, options?: FileOptions): Promise<void>;
  createDirectory(path: string, options?: DirectoryOptions): Promise<void>;
  fileExists(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
  directoryExists(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
  backupFile(path: string): Promise<string>;
  restoreFile(backupPath: string, originalPath: string): Promise<void>;
  setPermissions(path: string, permissions: number): Promise<void>;
}
```

### TR-002: Backup Strategy
- Backup files use pattern: `{originalPath}.backup.{timestamp}`
- Timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Backup directory: Same directory as original file
- Backup metadata: Store backup information for tracking

### TR-003: File Options
```typescript
interface FileOptions {
  overwrite?: boolean;
  backup?: boolean;
  permissions?: number;
  encoding?: string;
  validate?: boolean;
}
```

### TR-004: Directory Options
```typescript
interface DirectoryOptions {
  recursive?: boolean;
  permissions?: number;
  ignoreExisting?: boolean;
}
```

### TR-005: Validation Functions
```typescript
interface FileValidator {
  validateContent(content: string, filePath: string): ValidationResult;
  validatePermissions(path: string, expectedPermissions: number): ValidationResult;
  validateEncoding(path: string, encoding: string): ValidationResult;
}
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Safety
- Never overwrite files without explicit permission
- Always create backups before modification
- Validate file operations before and after execution
- Provide clear rollback instructions

### NFR-002: Performance
- File operations should complete in under 5 seconds
- Backup creation should not significantly slow down operations
- Directory creation should be optimized for nested structures
- File validation should be fast and non-blocking

### NFR-003: Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Support Windows, macOS, and Linux file systems
- Handle different path separators correctly
- Respect platform-specific file permissions
- Handle case-sensitive vs case-insensitive file systems

### NFR-004: Error Handling
- Graceful handling of permission errors
- Clear error messages for common issues
- Recovery options for failed operations
- Logging of all file operations for debugging

### NFR-005: User Experience
- Clear progress indicators for long operations
- Informative success/failure messages
- Helpful guidance for error resolution
- Consistent behavior across different scenarios
