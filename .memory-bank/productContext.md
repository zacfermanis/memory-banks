# Product Context: Memory Banks

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
AI agents working on software projects often lose context between sessions. When developers switch between different AI tools or restart conversations, the AI agent has no memory of:
- Previous architectural decisions
- Code patterns established in the project
- Current development status and next steps
- Technical constraints and requirements
- Project-specific conventions and preferences

This leads to:
- Repeated explanations of project context
- Inconsistent code patterns and decisions
- Lost productivity from context switching
- AI agents making assumptions that don't align with project history

### The Solution
Memory Banks provides a standardized way for developers to maintain AI agent context through structured documentation files. The CLI tool automates the setup process, making it easy for any developer to implement memory bank systems in their repositories.

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Discovery**: Developer learns about memory banks concept
2. **Installation**: Runs `npx memory-banks init` in their repository
3. **Configuration**: Chooses language/framework and memory bank pattern
4. **Setup**: Tool automatically creates appropriate files and structure
5. **Usage**: Developer and AI agents use the memory bank files for context
6. **Maintenance**: Memory bank files are updated as project evolves
