# Project Brief: Memory Banks

## Project Overview
Memory Banks is a CLI tool designed to help developers implement memory bank systems in their repositories. The tool provides npx scripts that automatically install and configure memory bank files, enabling AI agents to maintain context across development sessions.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goal
Create a seamless developer experience for implementing memory bank systems that help AI agents maintain project context and continuity.

### Key Objectives
1. **Automated Setup**: Provide npx scripts that install memory bank files into existing repositories
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Support different programming languages and frameworks with appropriate templates
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Allow developers to choose from different memory bank patterns and structures
4. **Developer-Focused**: Target developers who want to improve AI agent collaboration in their projects

### Success Criteria
- Developers can run a single command to set up memory banks in their repo
- Multiple language/framework options are available
- Setup process is intuitive and requires minimal configuration
- Generated files follow best practices for AI agent memory management

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- CLI tool development using TypeScript, Commander, and Inquirer
- Template system for different languages/frameworks
- npx package distribution
- Documentation and usage guides
- Multiple memory bank pattern options

### Out of Scope (Initial Version)
- Web UI for configuration
- Complex customization options
- Integration with specific AI platforms
- Advanced analytics or reporting

## Technical Constraints
- Must work as an npx package
- Should be lightweight and fast to install
- Must support multiple operating systems
- Should integrate well with existing development workflows

## Timeline
Personal open-source project with flexible timeline. Focus on Web/TypeScript implementation first, then expand to other languages.
