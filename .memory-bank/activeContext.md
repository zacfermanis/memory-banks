# Active Context: Memory Banks

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Initialize the memory bank system for the memory-banks CLI tool project. This involves creating the foundational documentation structure that will guide all future development work.

### Immediate Goals
1. âœ… **Memory Bank Initialization**: Create all core memory bank files
2. âœ… **Project Structure Setup**: Establish the basic CLI tool structure
3. ðŸ”„ **Core CLI Implementation**: Implement template system and file generation

## Recent Changes

### Project Setup Completion (Current Session)
- âœ… **TypeScript Project Structure**: Created complete TypeScript project with proper configuration
- âœ… **Package Configuration**: Set up package.json with all required dependencies and scripts
- âœ… **Development Environment**: Configured TypeScript, Jest, ESLint, and Prettier
- âœ… **CLI Framework**: Implemented basic Commander.js command structure
- âœ… **File System Utilities**: Created safe file operations with backup functionality
- âœ… **Testing Infrastructure**: Set up Jest with TypeScript support and basic tests
- âœ… **Template Structure**: Created basic TypeScript template configuration
- âœ… **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage instructions

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Focus on Web/TypeScript First**: Prioritize TypeScript CLI implementation before expanding to other languages
2. **npx Distribution Strategy**: Use npx for easy installation and usage
3. **Template-Based Architecture**: Design system around configurable templates for different project types
4. **Safety-First File Operations**: Never overwrite existing files without explicit permission

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. **Template Engine Implementation**
   - Create template registry system
   - Implement template rendering engine
   - Add variable substitution functionality

2. **Interactive Prompts**
   - Implement Inquirer.js prompts for template options
   - Add validation for user inputs
   - Create progress feedback system

3. **File Generation**
   - Connect template engine to file system utilities
   - Implement safe file writing with backups
   - Add error handling and rollback functionality

### Short-Term Goals (1-2 weeks)
1. **Working MVP**
   - Basic `npx memory-banks init` command
   - TypeScript template with memory bank files
   - Simple interactive prompts

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for CLI commands
   - Template validation tests

3. **Documentation**
   - README with usage instructions
   - Template development guide
   - Contributing guidelines

### Medium-Term Goals (1-2 months)
1. **Template Expansion**
   - Lua/Love2D template
   - Additional TypeScript patterns
   - Custom template support

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Project detection and auto-configuration
   - Template customization options
   - Update/upgrade functionality

3. **Community Building**
   - Open source release
   - Documentation website
   - Community template repository

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **Template Storage**: Whether to embed templates in the package or load from external sources
2. **Configuration Persistence**: How to handle user preferences and defaults
3. **Error Recovery**: Strategy for handling failed installations and rollbacks
4. **Performance Optimization**: Whether to use bundling tools or stick with tsc

### Design Questions
1. **Template Customization**: How much customization should be allowed vs. maintaining consistency?
2. **Language Support Priority**: Which languages/frameworks should be supported first?
3. **Integration Strategy**: How to integrate with existing project workflows and tools?

### User Experience Considerations
1. **Onboarding Flow**: How to make the initial setup as smooth as possible
2. **Error Messages**: Ensuring clear, actionable error messages
3. **Progress Feedback**: Providing clear indication of what's happening during setup

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **Test-Driven Development**: All code must be written in response to failing tests
- **Functional Programming**: Prefer immutable data and pure functions
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Use strict TypeScript configuration
- **Small, Focused Functions**: Keep functions small and single-purpose

### Code Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Organize code by features rather than technical layers
- **Clear Separation**: Separate CLI interface from business logic
- **Template Abstraction**: Keep template system independent of CLI implementation

### Quality Standards
- **100% Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage
- **Linting and Formatting**: Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with helpful messages

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights from Initial Planning
1. **Template System Complexity**: The template system needs to be flexible enough for different project types while maintaining consistency
2. **User Experience Critical**: The success of the tool depends heavily on the initial user experience
3. **Safety First**: File system operations must be safe and non-destructive
4. **Extensibility Important**: The system should be easy to extend with new templates and features

### Potential Challenges Identified
1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring the tool works consistently across different operating systems
2. **Template Maintenance**: Keeping templates up-to-date with best practices
3. **User Adoption**: Getting developers to adopt and maintain memory bank systems
4. **Performance**: Ensuring fast installation and execution times

### Success Factors
1. **Simplicity**: The tool must be easy to use and understand
2. **Effectiveness**: Generated memory banks must actually improve AI agent performance
3. **Flexibility**: Support for different project types and preferences
4. **Community**: Building a community around memory bank best practices

## Current Blockers and Dependencies

### No Current Blockers
- All memory bank files have been created successfully
- Project scope and requirements are clearly defined
- Technical architecture is well-planned

### Dependencies
- Node.js and npm for development environment
- TypeScript, Jest, and other development tools
- Commander.js, Inquirer.js, and Chalk for CLI functionality

## Notes for Future Sessions

### Important Context
- This is a personal, open-source project with flexible timeline
- Focus is on Web/TypeScript implementation first
- Goal is to create a tool that helps developers improve AI agent collaboration
- Success depends on user experience and effectiveness of generated memory banks
