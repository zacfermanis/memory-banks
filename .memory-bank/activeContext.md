## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **Template Storage**: Whether to embed templates in the package or load from external sources
2. **Configuration Persistence**: How to handle user preferences and defaults
3. **Error Recovery**: Strategy for handling failed installations and rollbacks
4. **Performance Optimization**: Whether to use bundling tools or stick with tsc

### Design Questions
1. **Template Customization**: How much customization should be allowed vs. maintaining consistency?
2. **Language Support Priority**: Which languages/frameworks should be supported first?
3. **Integration Strategy**: How to integrate with existing project workflows and tools?

### User Experience Considerations
1. **Onboarding Flow**: How to make the initial setup as smooth as possible
2. **Error Messages**: Ensuring clear, actionable error messages
3. **Progress Feedback**: Providing clear indication of what's happening during setup

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **Test-Driven Development**: All code must be written in response to failing tests
- **Functional Programming**: Prefer immutable data and pure functions
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Use strict TypeScript configuration
- **Small, Focused Functions**: Keep functions small and single-purpose

### Code Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Organize code by features rather than technical layers
- **Clear Separation**: Separate CLI interface from business logic
- **Template Abstraction**: Keep template system independent of CLI implementation

### Quality Standards
- **100% Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage
- **Linting and Formatting**: Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with helpful messages

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights from Implementation
1. **Template System Success**: The template system is flexible and extensible, supporting variable substitution and comprehensive configuration
2. **User Experience Achieved**: The CLI provides an intuitive and helpful experience with clear feedback and error handling
3. **Safety Implemented**: File system operations are safe with automatic backups and conflict resolution
4. **Extensibility Confirmed**: The system architecture supports easy addition of new templates and features

### Implementation Success Factors
1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns between CLI, template engine, and file operations
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
3. **Interactive Design**: Smooth user experience with Inquirer.js prompts and Chalk formatting
4. **Template Flexibility**: Rich template system with variable substitution and validation

### Implementation Achievements
