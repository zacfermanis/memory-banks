# Active Context: Memory Banks

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Complete the memory-banks CLI tool implementation and prepare for initial release. The project has made significant progress with core functionality implemented and now has a comprehensive help/documentation system and advanced logging. The next step is Testing and Quality Assurance.

### Immediate Goals
1. âœ… **Memory Bank Initialization**: Create all core memory bank files
2. âœ… **Project Structure Setup**: Establish the basic CLI tool structure
3. âœ… **Core CLI Implementation**: Implement template system and file generation
4. âœ… **Help and Documentation**: Comprehensive help system, command documentation, verbose/debug modes
5. ðŸ”„ **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Complete unit/integration tests and CLI workflow validation
6. ðŸ”„ **Package Distribution**: Prepare for npm package release

## Recent Changes

### Phase 7: Help and Documentation Completion (Current Session)
- âœ… **Comprehensive Help System**: Added topic-based, command-specific, and interactive help
- âœ… **Command Documentation**: All commands now have detailed help text, examples, and troubleshooting
- âœ… **Verbose/Debug Modes**: Logger integrated into all commands, respecting global flags
- âœ… **Consistent Output**: All CLI output and errors now use Logger for consistency

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Focus on Web/TypeScript First**: Prioritize TypeScript CLI implementation before expanding to other languages
2. **npx Distribution Strategy**: Use npx for easy installation and usage
3. **Template-Based Architecture**: Design system around configurable templates for different project types
4. **Safety-First File Operations**: Never overwrite existing files without explicit permission

   - Community template repository

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **Template Storage**: Whether to embed templates in the package or load from external sources
2. **Configuration Persistence**: How to handle user preferences and defaults
3. **Error Recovery**: Strategy for handling failed installations and rollbacks
4. **Performance Optimization**: Whether to use bundling tools or stick with tsc

### Design Questions
1. **Template Customization**: How much customization should be allowed vs. maintaining consistency?
2. **Language Support Priority**: Which languages/frameworks should be supported first?
3. **Integration Strategy**: How to integrate with existing project workflows and tools?

### User Experience Considerations
1. **Onboarding Flow**: How to make the initial setup as smooth as possible
2. **Error Messages**: Ensuring clear, actionable error messages
3. **Progress Feedback**: Providing clear indication of what's happening during setup

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **Test-Driven Development**: All code must be written in response to failing tests
- **Functional Programming**: Prefer immutable data and pure functions
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Use strict TypeScript configuration
- **Small, Focused Functions**: Keep functions small and single-purpose

### Code Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Organize code by features rather than technical layers
- **Clear Separation**: Separate CLI interface from business logic
- **Template Abstraction**: Keep template system independent of CLI implementation

### Quality Standards
- **100% Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage
- **Linting and Formatting**: Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with helpful messages

## Learnings and Project Insights
