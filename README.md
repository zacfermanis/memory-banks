## ✨ Features

- **🎯 AI-Ready Setup**: Pre-configured environments optimized for AI agent collaboration
- **📚 Memory Management**: Structured documentation system for project knowledge retention
- **⚡ Cursor Integration**: Custom `.cursorrules` for enhanced IDE experience
- **🛠️ Multi-Platform Support**: TypeScript/React/Next.js, Lua/Love2D, and Java/Spring Boot development
- **📋 SPEC-Driven Development**: Systematic feature development workflow
- **🔧 Zero-Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults

## 📦 Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @zacfermanis/memory-bank
```

### One-time Usage

```bash
npx init-memory-bank
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Supported Development Environments

Memory Bank for Agents supports three main development environments:

- **🌐 Web Development** - TypeScript, React, Next.js, and modern web technologies
- **🎮 Lua Development** - Lua programming language and Love2D game framework
- **☕ Java Development** - Java programming language and Spring Boot framework

Each environment comes with:
- Customized development guidelines and best practices
- Technology-specific architecture patterns
- Optimized `.cursorrules` for AI collaboration
- Comprehensive documentation templates

### Quick Start

1. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Run Memory Bank for Agents:**
   ```bash
   npx init-memory-bank
   ```

3. **Choose your development environment:**
   - **🌐 Web** - TypeScript/React/Next.js development
   - **🎮 Lua** - Lua/Love2D game development
   - **☕ Java** - Java/Spring Boot development

### Interactive Setup

Memory Bank for Agents will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
🚀 Memory Bank Initializer
==========================

? What type of memory bank would you like to install?
  ❯ Lua - For Lua/Love2D game development
    Web - For TypeScript/React/Next.js development
    Java - For Java/Spring Boot development
```

## 📁 Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have the following structure:

```
your-project/
├── .memory-bank/           # AI memory and documentation system
│   └── developmentGuide.md # Development guidelines and best practices
├── .specs/                 # Feature specifications and requirements
└── .cursorrules           # IDE configuration for AI collaboration
```

Memory Bank for Agents creates the foundation structure. You can then expand the Memory Bank system by creating additional documentation files as needed.

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Husky Git Hooks

This project uses Husky to automatically manage version bumping and quality checks:

- **🧪 Pre-commit Quality Checks**: Tests and builds run before commit to ensure code quality
- **📦 Post-commit Version Bumping**: Patch version is automatically incremented after successful commit
- **🔨 Build Verification**: TypeScript compilation is verified on every commit

#### Manual Version Bumping

If you need to manually bump the version:

```bash
npm run bump-version
```

This will increment the patch version (e.g., 2.0.9 → 2.0.10).

#### Hook Details

**Pre-commit Hook** (runs before commit):
1. Runs all Jest tests to ensure code quality
2. Builds the TypeScript project to catch compilation errors
3. Only allows commit if all checks pass

**Post-commit Hook** (runs after successful commit):
1. Bumps the package version automatically for the next commit
2. Runs tests again to ensure version bump didn't break anything
3. Rebuilds the project to ensure everything still compiles

### 🧠 Creating Memory Bank Files

After installation, you can create the complete Memory Bank documentation system by running this command in your AI agent:

```
initialize memory bank
```

This will create all the necessary Memory Bank files:
- `projectBrief.md` - Project foundation and goals
- `productContext.md` - Product vision and user experience  
- `activeContext.md` - Current work focus and decisions
- `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and technical patterns
- `techContext.md` - Technology stack and setup
- `progress.md` - Project status and milestones

### 📋 SPEC-Driven Feature Development

After initializing your Memory Bank, you can use the SPEC-driven design process to systematically develop new features. When you want to create a new feature, use this prompt with your AI agent:

```
using the SPEC driven design process, create a new feature that: [describe your feature]
```

For example:
```
using the SPEC driven design process, create a new feature that: allows users to export their memory bank data to JSON format
```

The SPEC process will guide you through:
1. **Requirements Phase** - Define user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **Design Phase** - Create architecture and component design
3. **Tasks Phase** - Break down implementation into actionable tasks

This ensures systematic, well-documented feature development that integrates seamlessly with your Memory Bank system.

## 🧠 Memory Bank System

### Core Components

- **Project Brief**: Foundation document defining core requirements and goals
- **Product Context**: User experience goals and problem-solving approach
- **Active Context**: Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps
- **System Patterns**: Architecture decisions and technical patterns
- **Tech Context**: Technology stack, dependencies, and development setup
- **Progress Tracking**: What works, what's left to build, and known issues

### Memory-Driven Development

The Memory Bank system ensures:
- **Consistent Context**: AI agents maintain project understanding across sessions
- **Knowledge Retention**: Important decisions and patterns are preserved
- **Efficient Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand project state
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic documentation prevents knowledge loss

This project was primarily inspired by the innovative system prompts and AI collaboration approaches developed by:

- **Cline** - Whose sophisticated system prompt engineering and AI agent memory management techniques provided the foundational concepts for the Memory Bank system
- **AWS Kiro** - Whose advanced AI development workflows and documentation strategies influenced the SPEC-driven development process and project structure

Additional inspiration came from:
- The Cursor IDE team for their innovative approach to AI-assisted development
- The broader AI development community for pushing the boundaries of human-AI collaboration

Built with ❤️ for the AI development community, this tool aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and human development workflows.
